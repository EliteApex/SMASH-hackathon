## Prompt description and background 
Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by massive cosmic events. We detect those by LIGO's two interferometers in Washington and Louisiana, which enable signal verification, noise reduction, and enhanced sensitivity.
Traditional methods like matched filtering are effective for known gravitational-wave sources, such as merging black holes and neutron stars, but struggle with other unmodeled phenomenas. The purpose of this project was 
 to develop machine learning models to identify transient gravitational-wave anomalies from unknown sources. 

## Model description 
Our final submitted model is a transformer feeding into an auto encoder model that capture temporal aspects of the data. Four additional features have been engineered for the model to process, including power and dominant frequency.
